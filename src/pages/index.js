        Hi, Iâ€™m <span>Grant Garrett</span>, a Product Designer living in
        Portland, Oregon.
      </h1>

      <p>
        My focus is creating simple, user centered designs that are based on
        research, data, and a strong understanding of the users goals and
        motivations. I believe that great design is inherently inclusive and
        that everyone can (and should) contribute to design.
